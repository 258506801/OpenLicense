      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

重新分发作品或及其衍生作品时，用户可选择提供或为符合本许可证承担之支持、担保、赔偿或其它职责义务和/或权利而收取费用。但是，在承担上述义务时，用户只可代表用户本身和用户本身责任来执行，不用也不能代表任何其它贡献者，并且用户仅可保证、防护并保持每个贡献者不受任何因此而产生的责任或对因用户自身承担这样的保证或附加责任而对这样的贡献者所提出的索赔。
